We appear to be searching `~/.julia/artifacts` first; this isn't the end of the world, but perhaps, for artifacts, we should reverse the order of depots?

We are now installing things into `stdlib` from `deps`.  Not fatal, but troubling.

The inconsistency of __init__() methods is somewhat troubling.  It's not fatal, but it's troubling.  I'm working around this by eliminating dependency on compile-time dlopen()'ing whenever possible.

Still need to do LLVM and CSL


Deps Dependency tree:

* MPFR
  - GMP
* SuiteSparse
  - OpenBLAS
* LLVM
* LibGit2
  - curl
    - Zlib
    - LibSSH2
      - MbedTLS
* dSFMT
* OpenLibm
* LibUV
* p7zip
* PCRE
* LibUnwind
* utf8proc
* Zlib
