It appears that we have a tricky circular dependency.  LibGit2 depends on LibGit2_jll, which depends on Pkg, which depends on LibGit2 again.

Because we only have one version of LibGit2 that we support, we can dump some of the version() checks.

We appear to be searching `~/.julia/artifacts` first; this isn't the end of the world, but perhaps, for artifacts, we should reverse the order of depots?

Can't do GMP and MPFR, as they are actually in Base, and I can't load JLLs at that point.  :(

If we hack around Pkg support in JLLs, we will bake certain platforms into the JLLs, so you won't be able to switch with something like PackageCompilerX.

Still need to PCRE_jll, LLVM_jll

One thing that kind of concerns me is that the buildsystem now really entangles Base and stdlib, since we are satisfying binary dependencies in Base (pcre, LLVM, GMP/MPFR) through binaries provided by the stdlib.  That doesn't feel very good to me.

The inconsistency of __init__() methods is somewhat troubling.  It's not fatal, but it's troubling.
